This configuration is without evil keybindings. The keybinding is a mix standard (doom) emacs and xah-fly-keys, some ideas inspired from Intellij Idea, Firefox  emacs-rocks.
I like to switch emacs profiles to try other configurations, therefore a shell script ~emacs-switcher.sh~ exists. It works well together with [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs][change emacs]].
